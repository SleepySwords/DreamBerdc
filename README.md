An attempt to make my first language, why not make it perfect.


## This isn't perfect :(
Unfortunately, I wanted an excuse to try using llvm so this is a statically type language. Type annotations do matter :(

Perhaps one day, I'll follow the [crafting interperters book](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) and properly implement [`C`](https://github.com/TodePond/C)
